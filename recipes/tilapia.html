        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>0.5 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.</li>
        </ol>
